    <h1>Causes</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>We believe that&nbsp;<strong>all people are created in the image of God and endowed with equal dignity and
                worth.</strong> Civil Rights are not a luxury to be granted, they are the bedrock of a just society.</li>
        <li>We believe that this fundamental&nbsp;<strong>dignity and equal treatment under the law should never be
                denied on the basis of race or ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, or ability.</strong></li>
        <li>We believe that&nbsp;<strong>these rights apply to all people everywhere,</strong> not just those belonging
            to a particular nation or born in a particular place.</li>
        <li>And finally, we believe that&nbsp;<strong>education, economic assistance/development, and protection from
                violence or the fear of violence are concrete ways we can help those in need&nbsp;to achieve the
                dignity and equality they deserve.</strong></li>
    </ul>
